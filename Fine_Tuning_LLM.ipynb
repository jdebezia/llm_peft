But due to the presence of large number of screws in spine as well as the involvement of sacroiliac joint I can't rule out disc prolapse, intervertebral disk degenerative disease and other conditions like Ankylosing spondylitis, Fibromyalgia which can cause such kind of pain as well. In my opinion, it would be beneficial to get clinically examined by an orthopedic surgeon who can thoroughly evaluate your lower limb and spine problems along with performing some investigations required. Hope this helps. Take care. Please feel free to ask more queries if any.\n",

I have not had a break from them in so long i mentally cant take it anymore..Any suggestions?\n",
            "Generated Answer: Based on your symptoms and history of recurrent oral ulcers, I would recommend that you visit an ENT surgeon or oral pathologist for a thorough physical exam and possible biopsy if indicated. Most often these lesions occur due to autoimmune disorders (including hereditary) which may be treated with immune suppressants like azathioprine or methotrexate. In some cases surgery is indicated. It is important to note that in many people these lesions tend to be very temporary and resolve themselves without any intervention in the future. Therefore it might be wise to rule out other conditions as well especially since these ulcers can be associated with other medical conditions such as HIV, HIV-related dementia, etc. If you think this is something related to your lifestyle, it might also be worthwhile to consider avoiding irritant foods and habits as well.

He has the history of Hypertention, Diabetics for a decade also suffers from gastric ulcers. Some of our well wishers contemplating on going for KEELEYs method of treatment to avoid surgery. Can you please give details about this method and how far it is successful as an alternative to bypass surgery. Thank you very much. P. Srinivasulu / INDIA.\n",
            "Generated Answer: Dear P.Srinivasulu Welcome to Chat Doctor. I am Surgeon Dr.Medical Cardiologist. We have various options like open heart surgery or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PCI) or percutaneous transluminal coronary arterio-synthesis(PTCA). The most common is PCI or CTG. In my opinion it is not good idea to do endoscopic procedures like CRYO, HEPO etc. These may cause major complications especially in hypertensive patients. I always suggest our patients to have percutaneous transluminal angiography (PTA), which is the most effective diagnostic tool to know whether or not coronary artery disease exist. If there is some kind of obstruction then angioplasty can be done at that time. Please don't consider any other option because these options have many serious complications specially in hypertensive patients. Please get his heart condition evaluated by a cardiologist and start medication if required. You must keep monitoring him regularly. You should take advice of your cardiologist frequently. For further query visit ChatDoctor.\n",
            "Expected Answer: Hello thank you for posting here. I have gone through your description. Since he has two blocks in the heart arteries, and he is advice bypass, the right choice is to go ahead with bypass surgery. I don't know any therapy named KELLEY, but I suppose you are talking about ch elation therapy. This therapy is of no benefit for the patient. The blocks in the heart artery are embedded inside the heart vessel and any amount of medication or therapy cannot decrease it to make it vanish. Medications can only help to stop progression of the block. Definitive way to treat critical heart blockages is an angioplasty or bypass surgery. Had you been my patient my advice would be to go ahead with bypass? Bypass surgery requires a stay of 7- 10 days approx in the hospital. Patient can start walking usually by day 5 after surgery. It requires a recovery period of 20 -25 days, but the long term results of bypass are very good with patients having a good quality of life. Gastric ulcers can be treated with long term antacids. Gastric ulcers are not a contraindication for surgery. Wishing you good health thank you\n",

But some time test results are showing 84-98 and 112-158. she was getting fear kindly give your suggessions\n",
            "Generated Answer: Welcome to Chat Doctor I understand your concern. Gestational diabetes during pregnancy occurs when a woman's blood sugar (glucose level) goes up unexpectedly or higher than it should be. It can affect both mother and baby. High levels of glucose in the blood can cause problems for both mother and baby and this is called gestational diabetes. It is usually discovered when women start feeling unwell or having difficulties with normal daily activities like walking or climbing stairs, and when they start feeling tired more easily. The good news is that most pregnancies end without any lasting effects. If there is no complications and baby is well, then all is well too. Even if something is found to be wrong, doctors will work very closely with you to make sure everything is taken care of. However, in rare cases, the fetus may need to be delivered before birth because of serious health risks. Women have a chance to improve their health and control their blood sugar levels. Sometimes, drugs called oral agents may also be given as an alternative to insulin injections. If she has not received a proper consultation yet, I suggest you to go for an appointment with her gynecologist. She must be under observation at the hospital till the symptoms reduce. Once she reduces, she must follow-up regularly after delivery. Please don't forget to maintain the hygiene and take care of the baby accordingly. Hope this helps. Take care.\n",
            "Expected Answer: Hello and I hope I can help you today. Insulin is used to treat diabetes during pregnancy at all stages and is safe and effective. The disease of diabetes and high blood sugar is the part that is dangerous for the baby, and good glucose control is the best way to ensure a healthy child. Good blood glucose levels should be less that 95 for fasting levels and less than 120 after meals (2 hours).  If this is the way your wife checks her sugar, and you test at least 4 times daily, she is under very good control and should not need further adjustment of her insulin if her levels stay at the current level.  She should be checking her sugar fasting and then 2 hours after every meal.  So in summary, insulin is safe and absolutely necessary for the health of the baby if your wife has diabetes.  Please discuss the dosing regimen with your treating physician on a regular basis and make sure your wife checks her readings at least when she wakes up in the morning and then 2 hours after every meal.  She should also write down what she eats, so her doctor can also know if any changes need to be made in the diet. I hope this information was helpful and answered your question adequately. Best wishes to you and your wife for the rest of the pregnancy. Sincerely,\n",

            "Question: My husband was on hemodialysis for about a year.  Last December we began with peritoneal dialysis at home and have been doing this for almost a year.  He had his catheter moved last June as it was much too low.  Since then he has been retaining fluid in his abdomen.  He recently had a CAT scan and a ecocardiogram which showed a heart problem which his doctor said could be controlled with medication.  While in the hospital, his blood pressure dropped so low he was given a bag of saline solution which raised it but he was taken off this medication for his heart.  Now he is at home and has a physical therapist come to our home twice a week and he is doing light exercises but his biggest problem, which has been with him for about three months, is shortness of breath.  It is from all of the fluid in his abdomen pressing on his diaphram, etc.  He has increased his trouser size by two inches.  I called this to the attention of his nephrologist as his stomach is like a big bowl of jelly.  Nothing is being done to take care of this fluid except the doctor has put him back on hemodialysis with no reduction of fluid.  Is there a possibility that there is a leak inside from his catheter or could it be a buildup of fluids from the peritoneal dialysis which I understand does not always completely flush all the fluids out of his body? Sorry about this being such a long messge but we are at a wits end as to finding out what is causing this problem.  Could you possibly help us by offering your guideance about the fluid. Thank you in advance.\n",
            "Generated Answer: Hi, Thanks for asking. The condition which is mentioned here can be due to various causes including:1. Peritoneal dialysis2. Urethral stenosis3. Diaphragmatic hernia If your husband is having difficulty breathing, it will help if you get an echocardiography done first because some dilated vessels (due to high fluid levels) might obstruct the lungs. As per what you told me, the condition seems to be more related to the fluids accumulated inside the abdomen rather than the dialysis itself. I think, he should stop the peritonatal dialysis at the earliest and go for hemodialysis under supervision by a good nephrologist. Please consult a nephrologist as soon as possible. Hope this helps. You may contact me directly through Chat Doctor for further information. Regards.\n",
            "Expected Answer: HIT hanks for your query. If there is no active peritoneal dialysis going on, then the abdominal fluid collection is unlikely to be related to the Peritoneal dialysis catheter. Ascites or fluid in the peritoneal cavity can be due to a weak heart or liver problems. I would recommend a 2D Echocardiogram, Ultrasound of the abdomen and a diagnostic ascetic fluid tap. Based on the results we could make further recommendations. Hope this helps Good luck.\n",

            "Expected Answer: Hello.thanks for sharing your query Since it is already 8 months since the insertion was done, I won't think that the Implant should be a cause of the rashes you have. You may apply a mild topical steroid for 3-4 days to see if it improves. If you have itching, oral anti histamines may be taken. However, if your lesions persist, you must visit a dermatologist.PUPPY rash is a pregnancy related condition and resolves mostly within a week of delivery. A few women continue to experience symptoms into the postpartum period, but I think this not be related to the present symptoms. Hope this is helpful. Take care.\n",

Well first thing is to stop smoking as soon as possible as that may help in preventing further progression of your symptoms. But still if you don't do it, then it will require some treatment as well. As your symptoms also suggest, I would recommend you following:1) A course of a short acting muscle relaxant like levocetrizine should be taken twice daily till you feel better.2) For any sore throat take an anti-bacterial medicine with metronidazole three times a day. This might reduce your discomfort. If this doesn't work, go see a physician who would diagnose and treat your condition by giving oral steroid inhalers, which help in reducing pain.3) Avoid activities that cause neck strain, sit or stand straight, keep good posture and stretch your neck often. Hope my advice helps you. Please consult a local Physician asap. Take care and have a nice day!\n",

            "Generated Answer: Hello! I can certainly appreciate your concerns regarding seasonal allergy symptoms during the spring season. There are several possible explanations for your symptoms, including: 1) The weather itself. Weather conditions that include warm, dry air combined with pollen or other allergens may exacerbate nasal symptoms as well as cold/flu-like illness. It is best not to open doors/windows when the outdoor temperature reaches 80F. This could also be due to an increase in air temperature and humidity levels. 2) Air filtration devices. In addition to nasal medications, many people find that using an air purifier is helpful. Air purifiers tend to catch the pollutants that cause allergic symptoms. However, they may also trap some particles that contain allergenic compounds which should be removed before reaching your lungs. The EPA recommends annual cleaning to ensure maximum efficacy of filters. 3) Medications. You're currently taking over-the-counter antihistamines and steroids as prescribed by your physician; it's important to remember that these drugs work over time, and there's no need to stop or start medication without consulting your doctor. Some patients find benefit from either continuous exposure to the medications or using these agents at bedtimes to enhance sleep quality. These treatments usually require about 4-6 weeks for them to become effective after use. Remember that allergy shots are often used for severe seasonal allergies where the body's response exceeds its normal limits. Please feel free to consult me again if you have more questions.

I am also on Zoloft 150 daily, adderall 30mg bid & clonazepam as needed who I take a few night a a week\n",
            "Generated Answer: Hello, thanks for asking here. You seem to have taken several medications including metformin 1000mg twice daily for PCOS and Percocet which is an extended release pain killer with codeine and acetaminophen (10/650) for severe fractures. Metformin is a medicine used to treat diabetes by lowering your blood sugar levels. This is not associated with any liver damage. However, this does not cause any problems or concerns with your liver enzymes. Percodex is an over the counter analgesic commonly known as Tylenol 3 that can produce mild side effects like abdominal cramps and gas when taken alone but it has no direct correlation with liver problems, either acute or chronic. The combination of Metformin + Percodex may cause liver issues but only if you have been taking it for more than two years without any liver injury. This is a serious concern. In the absence of any other signs such as jaundice, yellowing of eyes, skin changes or bleeding, there should be no cause for worry at present. If liver tests come up to be elevated after starting these medicines, let me know immediately so that we could further evaluate it. All the best.\n",

            "Question: Hi I have something hanging off the inside part of my upper lip in front of my front two teeth . It is hanging superficially and I noticed it a couple days ago, but it has become more prominent. It is nonpainful, easily move-able, and is flat, smooth and kind of circular. When I left my lip it I can see it pretty clear, I thought it seemed cystic but I am not sure anymore. Please let me know what it could be. I brush regularly but havent dont anything else to it.\n",
            "Generated Answer: Hello, I read carefully your query and understand your concern. The benign lesion you describe seems to be an unusual development of tissue around the gum line. It could be a new structure that was formed by re-absorption or hypertrophy of tissues around the area where the tooth is anchored. Since there are no symptoms, nothing needs to be done now. However, if it appears to be inflamed or changes its shape over time, this will require professional attention from a dentist. I suggest you wait for few months before taking any action. If necessary, a biopsy may help you clarify the diagnosis. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. This service is provided by Chat Doctor.\n",
            "Expected Answer: Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor ! On your description - not painful, hanging (which I assume you mean not firmly attached but mobile) and the recent onset - I can tell that there is no likelihood of serious infection or dental cyst/tumor. It could be a granuloma or a papilloma. All conditions are self regressing and you don't have to worry. Try not to disturb it though, and if you develop signs of infection (reddening, fluid discharge, multiple sores in mouth etc.) get it attended immediately. If papilloma or granuloma increases in size and interferes with normal oral functions, it can be surgically removed under local anesthesia. Hope this helps! Thanks.\n",

You need to first rule out hormone deficiencies before starting any hormonal medication. Hormone supplementation will certainly help reduce your symptoms, but it does have side effects.

            "Generated Answer: Hello.  It is difficult for me to provide an accurate opinion without examining you, so please understand that the most accurate answers can only be provided through an actual examination. The common causes of chronic urinary tract infection (chronic urinary tract irritation), are bacterial infections like pyelonephritis, UTIs, or fungal infections. Some people may be predisposed to those conditions. I recommend consulting with your treating physician. They will perform some further diagnostic testing to determine what type of infection (if any) is present. It would also be helpful if you could obtain urinalysis reports done by another laboratory as well as repeat your blood chemistry. These tests should help confirm or rule out these possible conditions. If it was not treated the infection might recur leading to permanent damage to your kidneys. The other possibility is that you have developed endometriosis causing inflammation, pain and discomfort in various locations including the genital area, pelvis and lower back. The treatment for such condition involves surgery to remove fibroid tissue from the uterine wall and possibly other treatments such as hormones or anti-inflammatory medication.  There is also some evidence that these endometriotic cysts require surgical removal. Please take care. Hope this helps.\n",

These include migraine, ischemia of brain (less blood flow) and desalinating illness (where the covering of the nerves get damaged). The most common cause is migraine. There is no need to worry about this finding. Based on your moms symptoms, the neurologist would be able to come to a conclusion regarding the diagnosis. Medical treatment would help her get better.

            "Question: Hello, I was contacted by a condo building I am staying at for vacation. They told me there had been two cases of legionnares disease in the last thirteen months  I am taking my six year old grandson is there a risk? They said the werent sure if the disease was from the condos. Thank you, Tammy\n",
            "Generated Answer: Hello, It is true that people can be infected with Legionella bacteria from water or air which has high concentrations of bacteria (such as from a pool).  While these organisms cause diseases including pneumonia, skin rash and other symptoms, they do not transmit to people directly; they are spread by contaminated surfaces, such as carpeting or shower walls. The risk of contracting this disease depends upon how many people are exposed to it. If only a few people are exposed then there is little risk for infection. Most infections result when multiple people are exposed.\n",
            "Expected Answer: There is a small risk, otherwise they wouldn't have mentioned it at all. Since its only been 2 cases over 13 months, and they're not even sure it's the condos, the risk is probably very, very small but not zero. You will need to decide if even a tiny risk is too great for your comfort. You and your grandson will probably be okay, but since a source has not been identified and eliminated, it might still be possible to contract the disease. Hope this answers your question.\n",

            "Generated Answer: The treatment depends upon the severity of your condition, whether it has progressed or not and the location of the pain and swelling. If the condition doesn't respond to conservative measures (non-invasive) such as physiotherapy, then surgical intervention may be necessary. This would be in addition to the conservative measures which include: Ice application; anti-inflammatory medicines like ibuprofen; anti-arthritic exercises, etc. It might take few months before the healing process completes. Hope this helps.\n",
            "Expected Answer: Hello, As you met an accident where you were diagnosed with biceps retinopathy and supraspinatus tenosynovitis I wonder why the shoulder functions have not resumed even after 6 months. Have you taken an MRI of the shoulder? If so what was the reports? If not then please do take it. I suspect this to be a rotator cuff injury. Because any injury happening to the shoulder with two muscle injury falls in the group. The rotator cuff muscles are weak. You need to work out behind it. Shoulder function can resume only when we have good range of motion in passive for all the movements and also if we overcome the pain.  In fact, I should share one of the rotator cuff injury cases of mine. It was a case of 65 years old female with the above-mentioned injury. No passive or active shoulder movements. But to overcome the problems, I use to make the muscle tire by active ROM exercises and no weights. Just gravity assisted and gravity resisted ones. In fact all the shoulder movements like - flexion, extension, rotation, abduction, adduction and circumduction. At the end of the 12th week, she had the best movements without any kind of pain and shoulder was much stronger than before. I will advise you to look for a competitive physiotherapist who can help you get the best outcome score. If left untreated it will lead to other pathologies which are not accepted.

The breast tenderness could be due to hormones from the baby (breast feeding) as well as hormonal changes that occur with pregnancy.

Doctor is recommending vit D injections. Is it okay to take those injections because i heard injections are painful and have side effects apart from its cost.Thank you\n",
            "Generated Answer: Dear sir I would like to recommend your mother for oral supplement of vitamin D3 supplements. Vitamin D deficiency is very common in elderly women (60+). It can be seen by serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D levels. Most common cause of vitamin D deficiency is diet, as foods rich in vitamin D is rarely available. In your mothers case as she has undergone chemotherapy , there is increased metabolic demand and thus her body may require additional vitamin D supplies. But vitamin D supplements should not be taken without any indication as it can also lead to toxicity if over dose taken. Therefore it is important that her vitamin D level needs to be monitored regularly with blood tests or serologies . She could have been deficient before undergoing treatment so even if her levels come normal they need to be maintained at high values for at least two months. Please consult a dermatologist who will be able to advise you further about the best way forward for her. Regards.\n",

            "Generated Answer: Hello! It is not unusual for people to develop oral ulcers when they have retainer, as they can irritate the tissues. These ulcers usually heal within 3-4 weeks with the use of over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen and topical corticosteroids like benzaclin cream. However, if your ulcer persists longer than three weeks, I would recommend consulting with your dental provider to discuss possible causes for your persistent ulceration.\n",

As of now no need for X-rays until symptoms worsen, so for now take rest in bed and do not bend your arm and avoid weight lifting activity. You should take painkillers like ibuprofen or naproxen. Apply ice pack over injured area. Hope this helps, do ask for further assistance. Wishing you good health.\n",

However, I will attempt to give you some suggestions.1) It is true that frequent ejaculation may lead to erectile dysfunction due to reduced testosterone level. But this should be done in case of serious issues. For all normal men with no other symptoms like swelling of seminal vesicle, you need not worry about your sperm count. 2) Your symptoms seem to have started after 3-6 months of masturbation habit. So, your problems could be psychological rather than physical. Relax yourself and try to avoid mental anxiety which may cause stress.

Secondly, when you try to test your hardness, the hardness comes down, because at that moment, you are diverting from sexual thoughts.

When your baby is 10 months or older, it will learn to fall, so after falling, he learns how to fall. This process usually takes from one month to two months, depending on the child. Then the baby will learn to bounce up from the ground to sit, then stand. I strongly recommend that at this age, the parents should start to take care of the baby in other ways, such as pushing the baby on his back onto the bed, instead of laying down in the bed. As for the baby's sleep, I also suggest consulting with a pediatrician to give specific advice on when to bring your baby to sleep better.\n",

There are some symptoms which are found When brain injury occurs like persistent crying, seizures, persistent vomiting, bleeding from mouth or nose. If above symptoms are not present, then most of the time child does not have brain injury. However, it is better to get the child examined by a Euro surgeon, and if required a CT scan of head should be done. I hope this will help you. Take care.\n",

Very concerned and would appreciate some advice.\n",
            "Generated Answer: Hello, The TetraSyll is a medication that contains a variety of synthetic hormones that act as estrogen and progesterone in your body. When taken for an extended period, it can cause some effects in pregnancy but these are usually mild symptoms like headaches, nausea, etc. . If you take the medication correctly, it does not harm the baby. But if used incorrectly, there may be serious side effects like heavy bleeding and ectopic pregnancy.  Please consult a gynecologist for further clarification regarding safety while pregnant.  Take care.\n",
            "Expected Answer: Hi there,Tetras is an antibiotic which is not recommended to be taken in pregnancy, but it is not known to cause any major defect in the baby if taken during the first trimester. Studies have shown that it effects the baby if taken after 4 months of pregnancy, causing the babies teeth to be discolored and can cause hardening and cause excess calcification of teeth and bones which is irreversible. But, since you are exposed to tetracycline at such an early gestation it is very unlikely to have affected your baby. Only minor abnormalities are known to occur in few women. Do not be overly concern and get a NT scan at 11 weeks and an anomaly scan done at 20 weeks to check for anomaly. Hope this helps. Regards.\n",

She has been running a low grade fever and has been very tired.  The doctor ordered a ultrasound which was inconclusive and sent her to a surgeon.  She is getting a CT tomorrow as the ultrasound showed a nodule on the right and a mass on the left.  The surgeon said whatever it is it needs to come out.  What are they suspecting?She does not smoke or drink, has a history of atrial fib and was on amiodarone until her doctor discontinued it 2 months ago due to high liver studies.  she is now on only beta blockers.

            "Generated Answer: Hi there! You may be worried about the timing of your birth control pill. While it is best if taken as soon as possible after taking emergency contraception pills or when an intrauterine device or a contraceptive implant is inserted, you should have no worries about the effects of taking your birth control pill some time later. However, since you did take your birth control pill within the hour after having oral sex, then this can also prevent pregnancy. If you have any symptoms that are due to hormonal imbalance such as acne or bloating, these side effects will resolve as you return to your regular menstrual cycle. Please seek advice from a gynecologist regarding methods of contraception for long term protection.\n",

Panic attacks may not always cause physical symptoms like chest tightness, difficulty in breathing (swelling of throat), increased heart rate, lightheadedness, etc. In fact, many people who do experience such symptoms report that they feel better when panic episodes pass.

            "Generated Answer: Hydrocholide is a diuretic medication which should not cause low potassium. The reason for your dizziness could be low blood pressure and if it is caused by diuretics then the dizziness will subside once the diuretic is stopped. As I said before, the dizziness should be subsided when you stop taking this medicine. If it persists even after stopping the medicine, you would need to see a doctor who might advise further investigation like an EKG, ECG etc. Your doctor might also suggest blood test including a urinalysis to check for any underlying causes.

In case if your paps come out abnormal, it may indicate further investigations like biopsy or more invasive procedures like cryosurgery, loop excision, laser surgery.

The Acorn (Academic Allergy and Referral Network) Diagnostic Criteria for fibromyalgia were first published in 1990 but then revised in 2003. This new criteria is no longer used by health-care providers. However, there are many other clinical guidelines and criteria for fibromyalgia including the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Fibromyalgia Research Foundation criteria, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria, and the European Federation of the Societies of Pain (EFPS) criteria.

            "Expected Answer: Hi, thank-you for providing the brief history of you. A thorough clinical Musculoskeletal assessment is advised.a little knowledge about the fibromyalgia is needed. Fibromyalgia is a condition where the pain is in the fibers of the muscle. Each muscle is composed of multiple muscle fibers and inflammation happening there will lead to the dysfunction in the circuiting of the muscle fibers to produce the contraction and relaxation. Also to understand here that the medication is a symptomatic relief and not a long term solution as the body is a medicine of its own and medication used acts as a supportive therapy to allow body to heal on its own. Also, in my clinical practice most Fibromyalgia cases we recommend physical therapy, meditation and breathing exercises. As physical therapy will help improve the muscle refunctioning and also improve the metabolism and immune system to reduce the inflammation. Also, Therapeutic ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy have been useful to reduce the pain, but importantly exercises are the choice. Meditation helps improve the control over the anxiety and leads to cooling of aggression. Breathing exercises helps to improve the oxygen carrying blood cells which acts as a fuel in the metabolism and reduce the metabolic waste as well. RegardsJay In Chat Doctor.\n",

            "Generated Answer: Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor, I am your pediatrician Dr. Prateek. A temperature less than 97F or 37C is considered subnormal, which may also cause problems like the one your child is experiencing. Since this condition appears not related to any bacterial infection or other causes, there seems to be no immediate danger to your child's health. However, I would suggest you take a complete history from your child. Make sure that she/he does not have recurrent colds due to excessive cold exposure. The frequent sneezing should also be assessed by your doctor as these can lead to sinus infections. Once we rule out the possibilities, I think you need to give your kid a high quality multivitamin supplement (Vitamins A, D, E & C) once daily which will help his immune system function better, if any vitamin deficiency is present.

She had a tube that was drain excess fluid but she pulled it out because she was frustrated. Now she has a chest tube that is draining all the fluid because her lung collapsed. Her voice was going away for the past couple days but now it is completely gone. Is this associated with the liver failure or is there another explaination?\n",
            "Generated Answer: It may be due to the liver disease and not necessarily related to the chest tube. The fluid from the liver has to go somewhere so when it cannot pass through the veins it will appear as excess fluid which can cause respiratory distress especially when the lungs collapse together with the difficulty breathing at rest. Chest tubes are used primarily for this condition but sometimes they are also used for other conditions like heart failure, septic shock etc. But if your grandmother is being treated with medications for those conditions then it would also account for her breathing difficulties and difficulty speaking. If the fluids were coming out of the lungs, then the chest tube might have been put in earlier and drained them directly into the IV system instead of just draining them out into a collection bag. This might make the collection bag look like it is full rather than having the fluid enter into the lungs and the collection bag. Please consult her treating physician.\n",

            "Question: Hello, this is my question. I am a regular plasma donor at a facility here where I live. Every 4 months they take a blood sample to be sent off for a protein analysis, it usually takes 10 days to get the sample back. Normally I know when the sample will be taken so I take 10 days off from donating at all before and the sample always comes back fine (because I am older, 40, weight 153 and I  guess donating lowers my protein levels). I have had 2 samples come back recently with a protein of 5.9 (needs to be 6.0 or higher) and I am wondering what it is I need to be doing/and or changing to ensure that my levels are in range. Also, how is this different from the screening test they do every time I go in to donate to test my microhemocrotit? I have been out of range a couple times recently on that and was told to eat iron-rich foods. I am now including an iron supplement with my daily vitamins. I would appreciate any help or advice you could give, I am frustrated. Thank you!\n",
            "Generated Answer: Hi, It seems like your tests were done under normal conditions. The only thing that can cause abnormality in your results are: - High protein diet- Low protein intake or non-availability of protein in your body due to other causes- Inadequate intake of iron or vitamin B12- Dehydration or low sodium level- Low physical activity- Lack of sleep or stress- Unhealthy lifestyle habits. Kindly consult a physician and discuss about these possibilities. Hope I helped.\n",

It is advisable to take inhalers prescribed by a pulmonologist like betamethasone and prednisolone twice daily or fluticasone propionate twice daily. Get a pulmonologist review his breath test and make him prescribe appropriate treatment for nasal blockage.

However, I have read that doing masturbation  in this method puts pressure on penis and people who do that will not have good pleasure during normal sex. Is it true?\n",
            "Generated Answer: Hello dear, The position in which you lie down is quite important while having intercourse. Many doctors recommend using pillows to make yourself comfortable. So, if your partner doesn't like lying on their side or legs on the ground, then maybe use a pillow to ease yourself out of awkwardness. Also, it's really important to use lubrication for both partners so that it makes intercourse smoother and more enjoyable. There isn't much scientific evidence supporting the claims made regarding it being uncomfortable to have intercourse in bed after masturbation in a particular way. Please remember that even without taking proper care (like maintaining hygiene, avoiding excessive stress, etc.), you will experience sexual arousal. This might be due to hormonal changes, lifestyle factors, stress etc. You may masturbate but no need to worry about the effects as they would come naturally. I wish you good health. ChatDoctor\n",

You can enjoy sexual life for sure. There is one advantage with hand masturbation. After some time, the penis slightly bends towards right or left. This bend penis shaft gives more pleasure during sexual intercourse than straight penis. Hope this answers your query. Available for further clarifications. Good luck.\n",

            "Generated Answer: Hi, Thank you for posting your query. There are no evidence-based studies available for support of Divalproex sodium (Divalirubicin) being safe and effective in lowering the levels of ALT and AST enzymes. So, it may or may not do so if taken with low dose aspirin. Your cholesterol and triglycerides may increase with such medicines. However, there are other anti-epileptics that do not raise these liver functions. As per my knowledge, Triglyceride (TG) in blood is higher than normal when combined with other conditions like diabetes, obesity, fatty food, etc. I would suggest you to avoid all those habits and keep your total cholesterol below 200mg/dL to prevent rise in TG.

In your case, it is common in patients after removal of gallbladder because blood comes into the body through other routes.

            "Generated Answer: Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor, If the area is getting infected then an antibiotic ointment like neomycin can be applied twice daily. The other alternative would be oral antibiotics as well. Do not worry your self, if the area gets better then the condition is resolved, else consult a dermatologist and get evaluated. Wishing you good health take care. Regards.\n",
            "Expected Answer: Hi Dear, Welcome to Chat Doctor. Understanding your concern. Lip bite is very common kind of thing and there is no need to be panic about it. The area will take around week to heal but as you having recurrence It's due to frequent licking of your lips which leads to formation of cracks in skin and eventually fungal infection there.  It could be due to riboflavin deficiency as well. I would suggest you to\n",

            "Question: I had a crown put in three years ago.  I had not noticed any pain or problem with it, yet the dentist says he needs to replace it because there is decay under it.  Is this unusual? I thought crowns were permanent.  Should I get a second opinion, and how do I go about doing that??\n",
            "Generated Answer: Hello!  It is indeed quite rare for an old dental restoration like a crown to show signs of wear as severe as yours.  While the root of the tooth may have decayed, a crown has been placed over it, so one might expect some decay in the areas around it to develop as well.  This can also occur if gum recession has occurred over time. If this area is still inflamed and painful despite the presence of a crown, then a new crown would be needed.  The dentist should review all your treatment history; did you smoke at the time the crown was put in? Are you taking medications that cause dry mouth? Have you experienced other oral health problems since the last visit? The information provided does not indicate how much gum tissue is missing around the crown. If you were prescribed antibiotics, ask what type of antibiotic you are currently on. Do these medications affect your immune system? What about sugar restriction? Does the mouth have good brushing habits and how often are you visiting the dentist? The more detailed information given will help us better understand your condition and address it appropriately. Please call 1-800-DENTIST (1-800-363-8478) to schedule an appointment and have your concerns addressed. They will have you fill out a patient questionnaire.  After speaking to our team, they will be able to make a recommendation regarding your situation. Good luck!\n",
            "Expected Answer: Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. As per your complaint it is possible that if the margins of the crown is not intact and there is a gap between crown and tooth, water and food debris along with bacteria can seep into the tooth and leads to secondary Infection. In this case if the decay has not reached the nerves present in the center of tooth then you may not have pain, but the tooth can continue to decay. If this is the case you will have to get the crown removal, get the tooth filled or Root Canal treatment has to be done followed by replacing the crown. You can take a second opinion if you wish as well as you can send me a scan of the x Ray of the crowned tooth so that I can guide you how you should proceed for treatments. In case if tooth is decayed then the treatment advised to you is appropriate. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards. Chat Doctor.\n",

            "Generated Answer: Hi! This sounds like a serious problem, but not something that should cause concern unless it becomes very bad or if it causes significant distress to your friend. The fact that he eats spoons and pens (which he obviously doesn't eat) when he feels sad seems like he could have learned this from an adult or possibly his parents. You need to talk with him about why he does this since it may get worse over time. It might also be a sign of depression in which case he needs help getting proper treatment. In terms of reinforcement, it doesn't sound like it. But, you do have a right to feel upset by it.

            "Generated Answer: Hello! I'm Chat Doctor. From your history given here this is not any swelling in the lymph nodes and also doesn't indicate cancerous growth as such. This can be some other local tissue formation over the soft tissues around the ear area. The most common cause for which such swellings occur is an accumulation of fluid over a soft tissue. These are usually harmless and get dissolved within few days. But for more accurate diagnosis, I will request you to consult with a General Surgeon or ENT specialist nearby your place who after examining you could tell you better.

            "Generated Answer: Hi, Thanks for your question. It looks like there might be some inflammation in intestines which can cause bleeding and also changes in color as well. Usually it is a common finding when one has diarrhea or bloody stools due to inflammation or infection . It does not necessarily mean that something serious is happening. But as you have mentioned it has come down now and he will need further evaluation. He would require blood work and abdominal ultrasound which can rule out anything else apart from bleeding. I do hope my advice would be useful. Please let me know if you have any other queries too. Thanks.\n",

My fingers sooth me and keep me calm so i can sleep in a way nothing else can. i only do it at night and when im really tired.. please help\n",
            "Generated Answer: Dear Student, Thanks for writing to us. It is very normal for kids to have strong grip on their fingers especially if the hand is being held tightly by an adult. If you can't stop this habit then first of all don't be too upset about it. Instead concentrate on improving your grip skills through various exercises like holding onto objects, putting your hands near your mouth etc. This will gradually improve your strength and flexibility with your hand. Also consider practicing yoga or any physical exercises that will increase strength in general which include sitting straight up in chair, pushing chairs towards your head etc. Please consult a psychologist or counselor to work on psychological issues related to anxiety. They might suggest relaxation techniques like meditation, cognitive behavioral therapy etc. In case you wish to continue using them, let them help in reducing the frequency of use at least temporarily. Hope you find this information useful. Wish you good health. Chat Doctor.\n",
            "Expected Answer: Hi and welcome, Finger sucking and thumb sucking habit is very injurious as dental health is concerned. Although thumb sucking is a normal habit it causes serious teeth problems if it continues long after the eruption of permanent teeth.  Prolonged finger sucking can create crowded, crooked teeth and bite problems.  You may also develop speech problems or problems with swallowing properly.  Protrusion and displacement of front teeth are usual results of thumb sucking. This can affect your facial appearance and cause further emotional problems. You can follow few steps to avoid the habit\n",

The attached bridge has come totally undone, leaving the open gum. The prescription has been prescribed as a preventive measure. I have no pain and no sign of invection as yet . After reading the warnings that came attached with the prescription filled at Walgreens I am extremely hesitant to take the drug due to the severe side effects. Possible death due toStevens Johnson syndrome ... I live alone so I not going to take the drug and take my chances with invection. Is that a wise choice?\n",
            "Generated Answer: Clindamycin is an antibiotic. It may cause adverse events like Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) in some patients. This could lead to extensive skin lesions including blisters. Skin biopsy can confirm the diagnosis. However, this is a rare event though there were cases of SJS reported after using Clindamycin therapy. Please consult a dermatologist for proper management.\n",
            "Expected Answer: Hi. Thanks for the query. I have gone through your query and can understand your concern. Well taking Clindamycin does not always cause side effects and that too are not always life-threatening, so better first relax. If you go through the side effects of any antibiotics you will always find a long list but all the side effects are not always seen in each individual who take the Chat Doctor. . So my suggestion is to continue taking Clindamycin. If you still doubt you can go for Allergic testing and once confirmed you can take safer antibiotics without fear of fatal side effects.
